Hey, my name is Bryan, and I'm a 26 year old husband and front-end developer that lives in the NYC area.

I currently work at [TrueChoice Solutions](https://www.truechoice.io/); in fact, I've been with them my entire career (**over 4 years now**).

At TrueChoice, I have the opportunity, each and every day, to work with our amazing front-end development, dev ops and design teams, to deliver the best products we can. It truly is a blessing to be surrounded by and grow with such a stellar group.

Now, given everything I've been learning, I wanted to start this blog.  First and foremost, I just wanted to translate all of what I've been learning from my head into writing.  Personally, I love to just write everything out so that I can revisit at a later time.  But also, I love to write things out so that I can articulate whatever the topic may be to ensure I really understand it.  Secondly, I'll be writing down what I've learned with the hopes that it may be of value to others.  Specifically, I'll be writing about the **hard skills** (i.e technical topics) within the **React** ecosystem (e.g. `next`) and **soft skills**, which are also important when working within a team, **especially in a remote capacity**.

With all of that being said, thanks for checking the blog out. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or just want to say "what's up" at [bguillen95@gmail.com](mailto:bguillen95@gmail.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guillen-89b644214/).

All the best,

Bryan

Hey, my name is Bryan, and I'm a 26 year old husband and front-end developer that lives in the NYC area.

I currently work at [TrueChoice Solutions](https://www.truechoice.io/); in fact, I've been with them my entire career (**over 4 years now**).

At my time with TrueChoice, I've had the opportunity to work with an amazing development, dev ops and design team to deliver the best products we can. It's truly been a blessing.

Given everything I've been learning, I wanted to start this blog.  In it, I'll be writing down what I've learned, with the hopes that it may be of value to others.  Specifically, I'll be writing about the **hard skills** (i.e technical topics) related to the **React** ecosystem (e.g. `next`) and **soft skills**, which are also important when working within a team, **especially in a remote capacity**.

With all of that being said, thanks for checking the blog out. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or just want to say "what's up" at [bguillen95@gmail.com](mailto:bguillen95@gmail.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guillen-89b644214/).

All the best,

Bryan

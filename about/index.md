Hey, my name is Bryan, and I'm a 26 year old husband and front-end developer that lives in the NYC area.

I currently work at [TrueChoice Solutions](https://www.truechoice.io/); in fact, I've been with them my entire career (**over 4 years now**) -- this should tell you how awesome of a company it is.

At my time with TrueChoice, I've had the opportunity to work with an amazing development and design team to deliver the best products we can -- awesome products that solve our clients' needs. I've had the opportunity to continuously learn and work on really interesting projects. It's truly been a blessing.

Even though I currently work as a front-end developer and spend 80% of my time in that world, I absolutely love everything related to producing beautiful software and products. From build and deployment processes to back-end and other things, I love it all. As an example, lately I've gotten curious about crypto and Solidity.

It's a hot topic, but whenever I have extra time, I love to play around with Solidity. And because of that, I've even created a YouTube channel, which revolves around both Solidity and React/JS. You can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RkPuY6ksHLUCZzfetAWQw). But, one thing I really wanted to do was also write about my experiences as a front-end developer. And thus, this blog.

With this blog, I'll be writing down what I've learned, in the hopes that it may be of value to others.  Specifically, I'll be writing about the **hard skills** -- technical topics -- related to the **React** ecosystem and **soft skills**, which are also important when working within a team, **especially in a remote capacity**.

With all of that being said, thanks for checking the blog out. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or just want to say "what's up" at [bguillen95@gmail.com](mailto:bguillen95@gmail.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guillen-89b644214/).

All the best,

Bryan

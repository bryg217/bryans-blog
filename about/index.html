<p>Hey, my name is Bryan, and I'm a 26 year old husband and front-end developer that lives in the NYC area.</p>
<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.truechoice.io/">TrueChoice Solutions</a>; in fact, I've been with them my entire career (<strong>over 4 years now</strong>).</p>
<p>At TrueChoice, I have the opportunity, each and every day, to work with our amazing front-end development, dev ops and design teams, to deliver the best products we can. It truly is a blessing to be surrounded by and grow with such a stellar group.</p>
<p>Now, given everything I've been learning, I wanted to start this blog.  First and foremost, I just wanted to translate all of what I've been learning from my head into writing.  Personally, I love to just write everything out so that I can revisit at a later time.  But also, I love to write things out so that I can articulate whatever the topic may be to ensure I really understand it.  Secondly, I'll be writing down what I've learned with the hopes that it may be of value to others.  Specifically, I'll be writing about the <strong>hard skills</strong> (i.e technical topics) within the <strong>React</strong> ecosystem (e.g. <code>next</code>) and <strong>soft skills</strong>, which are also important when working within a team, <strong>especially in a remote capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, thanks for checking the blog out. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or just want to say &quot;what's up&quot; at <a href="mailto:bguillen95@gmail.com">bguillen95@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guillen-89b644214/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

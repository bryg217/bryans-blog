<p>Hey, my name is Bryan, and I'm a 26 year old husband and front-end developer that lives in the NYC area.</p>
<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.truechoice.io/">TrueChoice Solutions</a>; in fact, I've been with them my entire career (<strong>over 4 years now</strong>) -- this should tell you how awesome of a company it is.</p>
<p>At my time with TrueChoice, I've had the opportunity to work with an amazing development and design team to deliver the best products we can -- awesome products that solve our clients' needs. I've had the opportunity to continuously learn and work on really interesting projects. It's truly been a blessing.</p>
<p>Even though I currently work as a front-end developer and spend 80% of my time in that world, I absolutely love everything related to producing beautiful software and products. From build and deployment processes to back-end and other things, I love it all. As an example, lately I've gotten curious about crypto and Solidity.</p>
<p>It's a hot topic, but whenever I have extra time, I love to play around with Solidity. And because of that, I've even created a YouTube channel, which revolves around both Solidity and React/JS. You can check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RkPuY6ksHLUCZzfetAWQw">here</a>. But, one thing I really wanted to do was also write about my experiences as a front-end developer. And thus, this blog.</p>
<p>With this blog, I'll be writing down what I've learned, in the hopes that it may be of value to others.  Specifically, I'll be writing about the <strong>hard skills</strong> -- technical topics -- related to the <strong>React</strong> ecosystem and <strong>soft skills</strong>, which are also important when working within a team, <strong>especially in a remote capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, thanks for checking the blog out. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or just want to say &quot;what's up&quot; at <a href="mailto:bguillen95@gmail.com">bguillen95@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guillen-89b644214/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

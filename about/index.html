<time datetime="2021-10-17">17 Oct 2021</time>

<p>Hey, my name is Bryan, and I'm a 26 year old husband and front-end developer that lives in the NYC area.</p>
<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.truechoice.io/">TrueChoice Solutions</a>; in fact, I've been with them my entire career (<strong>over 4 years now</strong>) -- this should tell you how awesome of a company it is.</p>
<p>At my time with TrueChoice, I've had the opportunity to work with an amazing development, dev ops and design team to deliver the best products we can -- awesome products that solve our clients' needs. I've had the opportunity to continuously learn and work on really interesting projects. It's truly been a blessing.</p>
<p>Given everything I've been learning and all of the opportunities to grow that I've had, I wanted to start this blog.  In it, I'll be writing down what I've learned, in the hopes that it may be of value to others.  Specifically, I'll be writing about the <strong>hard skills</strong> -- technical topics -- related to the <strong>React</strong> (e.g. <code>next</code>) ecosystem and <strong>soft skills</strong>, which are also important when working within a team, <strong>especially in a remote capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, thanks for checking the blog out. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or just want to say &quot;what's up&quot; at <a href="mailto:bguillen95@gmail.com">bguillen95@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guillen-89b644214/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

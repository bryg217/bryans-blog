For today's post, I'd like to do something different.  I'd like to share a video that I recorded, just to add some variety (some spice) to this blog.  In this video, I'll be walking you through part of the architecture of a really small `next.js` application, with the hope that you may find some value in it.

Before diving into the video, it is worth highlighting the tech used:

* `next.js`
* `Typescript`
* SpaceX GraphQL API
* More

Additionally, it is worth sharing the links to the repo and another one I reference in the video:

* [Repo](https://github.com/bryg217/spacex-explorer)
* [SpaceX API](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.spacex.land%2Fgraphql%2F)

Without further ado, enjoy the video.  =)
